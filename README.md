# Project Title

## Project Description
This project is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline operations using a modern web application architecture. It leverages Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure that the complexity of business processes is adequately managed and aligned with the software's development.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with NestJS - Utilizes TypeScript to bring a powerful, server-side development environment that is scalable and maintainable.
- **Database**: SQLite - A lightweight, disk-based database that does not require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - Securely transmitting information as JSON objects in a compact and self-contained manner.
- **Testing**: Jest - Delivers a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
This project implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a methodology and set of priorities aimed at aligning the software with underlying business processes it represents. DDD focuses on three core principles:
1. **Focus on the Core Domain**: Concentrate on the business domain, its logic, and intricacies, ensuring the software accurately reflects and serves the business purposes.
2. **Rich Domain Model**: Encourages an intricate model that portrays complex business behaviors, enabling developers to write business logic that is more expressive and closely aligned with the domain experts' language.
3. **Bounded Contexts**: Promotes the division of the domain into manageable segments, each with its own domain model and language, helping to eliminate ambiguities and ensuring consistency.

### Benefits of Using DDD
- **Enhanced Communication**: Bridging the gap between technical experts and domain experts, fostering better communication and understanding across teams.
- **Scalability**: With clear boundaries defined, the system becomes easier to scale and integrate with other systems without the risk of domain logic leakages.
- **Maintainability**: Emphasizes a model closely aligned with the domain, making the system more intuitive to update and maintain as the business evolves.

## How to Run
To get this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Installation and Running the App
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Benardo07/Nest-js-todo-app.git
  ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
  ```bash
    cd NEST-TODO-APP
  ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
  ```bash
    npm install
  ```
4. ** Start the application**
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

This will start the server, typically accessible via http://localhost:3000. You can now interact with the API through your chosen API client or through the front end connected to it.
